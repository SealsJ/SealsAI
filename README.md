## Disclaimers
- This Project's APIs are personally Funded by me with a hard rate limit for Open AI / Replicate AI APIs. If you received a "Something went wrong error" towards the end of the month, these rate limits have probably been reached.
- Video and Music Generation require a lot of resources to generate and sometimes fallback on Vercel Deployment.
